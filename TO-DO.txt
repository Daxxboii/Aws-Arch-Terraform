River’s Deployment TODO

    ⁃    CI/CD (and deploying new microservices) 
    ⁃    Global event bridge
    ⁃    Global S3
    ⁃    Global DB
    ⁃    Active/Active SNS deployment (w logic to avoid double processing)
    ⁃    Active/Active SNS
    ⁃    api gateway endpoint for each microservice
    ⁃    Route53 DNS resolving for lowest latency
    ⁃    Cloudfront deployed on a global s3 bucket with cloudfront function deployed to redirect user based on latency


Proof:
    ⁃    deploy two microservices (1 finished)
    ⁃    use eventbridge on one service to asynchronously invoke the other
    ⁃    use multi region sqs and sns
